This was fairly the easiest long challenge I had ever participated. The questions were easy-moderate as compared to previous long challenges and due to which the submission rate was too high. Also the participation was at peak!!. In Codechef April long challenge 2020 my global rank was 8509. Though I solved 4 full problems ( All Correct ) and 1 partially correct, my rank went upto 8509 !!. You can see my solutions in this folder. Any issues or queries will be welcomed. Hope this helps :D
