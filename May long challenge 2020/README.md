This was really a tough competitive long challenge, the quality of questions as 
compared to April long challenge was moderate-to-tough. In Codechef May long challenge 2020 my global rank was 4301. 
This competition was so special to me, I became a 3 star coder on Codechef !!!. In this challenge, I got my best global rank so far.
I solved 2 full problems ( All Correct ) and 2 partially correct. You can see my solutions in this folder. Any issues or queries will
be welcomed. Hope this helps :D
